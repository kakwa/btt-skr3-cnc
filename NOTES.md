# Yeet'N C - Trying to revive a Yeti Tool CNC

## Introduction

Last year, I joined a local fablab, If you like building stuff, I would highly recommand you to try.
These are great place to learn new skills, spend time with wonderful people and play with machines out of reach of a typical toolbox.

One of these fun tools in my local fablab is a CNC router by Yeti Tool, but unfortunately, it has been broken ever since I joined.
And to complicate matters, the company [went under in 2024](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/11310906/insolvency), with only basic support and spare part are now available through [Trend UK](https://www.trend-eu.com/products/cnc-machines/trend-yeti-cnc-smartbench/trend-yeti-cnc-smartbench).

In our case, it's the electronic boards which have various issues, from broken connectors to fried components.

I might be way over my head, Duning Krugger style, but I've set my sight on trying to revive this router. As itself, it could be a fun project, and a step-up from building my small Voron 0.2. Not very reasonable, but as we say, You Live Only Once.

Even less reasonable, I'm actually not too keen on simply trying to fix the current electronic. It would probably be feasable, but:

.1 it would probably be a fragile bodge work likely to break again.
.2 even if it worked, would let the tool in an unmaintainable state, with no effective software or hardware support.
.3 I would not learn as much.

For all these reasons, plus my incurable Open Source ethos, I'm much more keen on trying to rebuild the whole controller & stepper driver stuff.
